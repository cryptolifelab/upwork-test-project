<font size="3">How many different/distinct secret keys can be generated using wp_generate_passowrd(8)? Don't worry! We don't use WordPress, but we are happy to understand how you navigate through documentation of packages you don't know (oops, this could be a hint). Please, answer this question in a document named answer.md inside the repo.</font>


<font size="2"> If, in addition to the password length, do not change optional parameters, then the result will be <span style="color:white; background-color: #999999">Math.pow(7, 21)</span> </font>
